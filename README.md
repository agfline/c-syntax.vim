# c-syntax.vim
C Syntax Highlighting Extension for Vim

Fork from the original Mikhail Wolfson [version](https://vim.sourceforge.io/scripts/script.php?script_id=3064), to which was added support for **C constants**.

## installation

Simply put the `c.vim` file in `~/.vim/after/syntax/`, and make sure you have `syntax on` in your `~/.vimrc` file.
